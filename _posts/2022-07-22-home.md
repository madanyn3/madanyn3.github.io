You have found yourself on the website of Madan Y N, a Design Engineer at the [AMD India Design Center](https://www.amd.com/en.html), Bengaluru 🇮🇳. By day, I help design CPUs to put bread (and sometimes pizza🍕) on my table. I graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay 🇮🇳. I take interest in computer systems and hardware🖥️(real software engineers know their hardware!), machine learning. I am always up for some elegant problems and having deep, meaningful conversations. Outside of work, you can find me engaged in a book or a podcast. Recently, I’ve started cooking for myself—so far, no kitchen disasters😁.

## Work

I am part of the CPU performance modeling team at AMD (My NDA stops me at this point). During my college I worked on some interesting projects in computure architecture and FPGAs. My internship at TATA Research, Mumbai 🇮🇳 constitutated designing low-latency architectures for ML models in reconfigurable hardware. I've done my share of research projects at IITB, comparing ISA architectures under Sunil Shenoy (SVP Formerly at Intel Inc.) and Prof. Laxmeesha, in Python-HLS under Prof. Madhav Desai. 

## Curiosities

AIML is arguably the biggest thing of our generation, I am curious to apply my skills to enhance the technology for the good of people. I am curious about the functioning of hunam body (a complex machine that somehow "just works") and and how individual behaviors scale up to shape populations. I also find myself thinking about the meaning of life—is it an accident or an eventuality? I plan to post blogs and some of my shower thoughts here—stay tuned!

#CodersStrongTogether

<!-- You have landed on the website of Vedang Asgaonkar, a senior undergraduate student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitb.ac.in) 💻 at IIT Bombay 🇮🇳. I take interest in computer systems and machine learning, particularly the mathematical side of it. I am always up for some elegant puzzles or problems 🧠. Contrary to popular belief, I do have a life. I enjoy hanging out with close friends, and am always up for new experiences. Travel is the love of my life (and food, the way to my heart), and I am a bit more adventurous than my insurance provider would like. You might find me in the gym or playing ping-pong if you drop by at a random time.

## Work

I have done some interesting projects in ML, networks and software development. My most recent internship was in low latency systems at Optiver Amsterdam 🇳🇱. I've done my fair share of research at IITB, in active feature acquisition under Prof. Abir De, and in time series retrieval under Prof. Sunita Sarawagi. I have also been involved in data science research in collaboration with IIMA and Stanford. I've also worked on evolutionary game theory at IST Austria 🇦🇹. 

## Curiosities

I am interested in logical insights on human and social behaviour, and read books and blogs about the same. Models of social interaction, opinion dynamics and competition pique my curiosity. I plan to post some blogs 💬 about the same in my free time (has not happened as of Fall'23). I enjoy writing convoluted sentences that take an entire [NVIDIA A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/data-center/a100/) GPU to understand.

## Teaching

Currently TAing for the undergraduate course in Artifical Intelligence and Machine learning, I have also conducted recitals for the minor course on Design and Analysis of Algorithms. I have also been a TA on the [NPTEL](https://nptel.ac.in/) platform for the course "An Introduction to Programming through C++". I may post resources for courses in the future. Some such resources can be found in my [github](https://github.com/VedangAsgaonkar) repositories. I have also worked as teaching assistant for linear algebra at the dept. of math at IITB.

## Contact me
Come and meet me in person at H17 IIT Bombay. Make sure to bring a protein bar 🍫 or a pizza 🍕 . Alternatively find me on LinkedIn, Instagram or Facebook 🔗. You can also drop a mail to [first name][at]cse[dot]iitb[dot]ac[dot]in
