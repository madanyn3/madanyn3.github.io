You have landed on the website of Vedang Asgaonkar, a third year undergraduate at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitb.ac.in) 💻 at IIT Bombay 🇮🇳. I take interest in computer systems and machine learning, particularly the mathematical side of it. I am always up for some elegant puzzles or problems 🧠.

I have done some interesting projects in ML, networks and software development. I have also been involved in data science research in collaboration with IIMA and Stanford. My most recent internship involved working on evolutionary game theory at IST Austria 🇦🇹 . Currently pursuing research in theoretical machine learning with Prof. Abir De at IITB. I am also scheduled to intern at Optiver Amsterdam 🇳🇱 in summer '23. 

I am interested in logical insights on human and social behaviour, and read books and blogs about the same. Models of social interaction, opinion dynamics and competition pique my curiosity. I plan to post some blogs 💬 about the same in my free time.

I worked as teaching assistant for linear algebra at the dept. of math at IITB. I have also been a TA on the [NPTEL](https://nptel.ac.in/) platform for the course "An Introduction to Programming through C++". I am currently a teaching assistant for the minor course on Design and Analysis of Algorithms. I may post resources for courses in the future. Some such resources can be found in my [github](https://github.com/VedangAsgaonkar) repositories.
