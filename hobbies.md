I indulge in a variety of random activities, completely unrelated to my career. Some might call them hobbies, but for me, they’re a great way to escape the present and recharge!

## Sports 🏐
I enjoy working out, playing badminton. I think I am an expert cricket🏏 analyst myself (courtesy to the interest fostered at home in my childhood)

## Music 🎧
Not a big music head! I listen to Metallica (the OG 80s) sometimes during work. Otherwise I prefer lo-fi music filled with violin and piano.

## Movies and TV Shows 🎥
I prefer movies and tv shows with a string story line. I can say I have watched many of the OG movies and Shows. Currently have developed a frenzy for serial killer thrillers!

## Books 📖
Until recently, my reading mostly revolved around course material. Similar to in movies, I prefer books that are likely going to leave a strong impression on me. Currently engaged in DUNE, Project Hail Mary.

## Music 🎧
I generally like soulful and lofi songs, typically with a good amount of guitar and piano. My playlists would only partially agree. They know that [I put my armor on to show you how strong I am](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=cfhwSpSDA9c).

## TV shows and movies 🎦
I prefer to watch light TV shows, generally sitcoms. My taste in movies is a total contrast, I like movies with a strong story line, typically with some amount of drama and a twist. 

## Sports ⚾
I enjoy working out, swimming and playing ping-pong. I generally prefer sports that are played solo or in small teams. -->
