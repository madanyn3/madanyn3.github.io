Since the beginning of the show, she has been the lead character and has been my favorite female character. The importance of her character was diminished to some extent in the later seasons as the party grew and fighting with the monsters involved more and more planning and teamwork, rather than El just shooting the guns. Even then, she remained the ultimate link between Hawkins and the Upside Down and everything beyond. Will finally picked up in season 5, but it is no secret that the party wouldn't have made it to season 5 if not for El. Remember her in seasons 1, 2 and 3? It took a while for her to regain power in season 4, but she was pivotal in saving Max and the rest. As I noted in my immediate thoughts, for the story of Hawkins to end, El had to die. I expected that her death will be something similar to her disappearance in season 1 (the *goodbye Mike* in Hawkins Middle School classroom as she sent the Demogorgon back to Abyss). I thought she would sacrifice herself to kill Henry and end the Mind Flayer shenanigans once and for all. What happened was completely different. 
<br>

Let's first take a look at what everyone thinks happened. The team kills Henry and defeats the Mind Flayer. Murray starts the bomb timer, and everyone makes their way out of the Upside Down through the mother gate at MAC-Z. We see El beside Mike the whole time. I cannot help but wonder how they did not expect the military to be waiting for them. Why could they not have come out through some other gate? Why didn't Hopper think it through? Military catches them all, only to find that El had somehow escaped and was standing in the Upside Down at the edge of the gate. She says goodbye to Mike and to everyone, and finally, she vanishes with the collapse of the Upside Down. 
<br>

This story fits well with El and Kali's conversation and how the military sees them only as weapons. There is no way things could've gone back to normal had Dr. Kay got hold of Eleven and instead had Eleven escaped, she would be running away from the US military her whole life. The story has major flaws, though. To start with, how did Eleven dodge everyone and get inside the Upside Down? The truck door was closed before soldiers opened it, and one soldier is seen taking El out of the truck too. How did she get past everyone and run through the gate? How did El use her powers to talk to Mike inside her mind with all the sonic booms (the unexplained antennas that stop her from using her powers) pointed right at her? Finally, why isn't her nose bleeding when she is using her powers for one last time? These are important questions, and the show just doesn't answer them. 
<br>

Now, let's look at Mike's theory. This seems to be the fan favorite. So basically, everything everyone saw about El dying with the Upside Down collapsing was a spell cast by Kali. El escaped the soldiers and made her way out through the tunnels. Once she was sufficiently far from the antennas, she used her powers to talk to Mike. As per the Epilogue, she ran away from everything without being caught, and it is not clear what happened to her. There are some major observations that support this theory. Well, it explains all three questions above. Further, as people have pointed out, when Kali is shot, El tries to stop the bleeding, and her hands are covered in blood. But when she comes to the lab rooftop, there is no blood on her hands. This in itself is not a strong argument, but it is something. Kali might have faked bleeding to make Hopper believe that she is dead, but then how come Hop did not notice blood in El's hand just vanishing? 
<br>

Both possibilities have their strengths and weaknesses, and having considered them, the second one does seem more likely to have occurred. The big question is, what happens after the escape? Has the military captured her, and is that why they let everyone go? If not, where is Eleven now? How did she escape Hawkins? There are a lot of questions that we will never know the answers to. From a logical perspective, Eleven's death is the only way to end the show, but of all the kids, she deserved to get a better ending than that. Maybe El is living somewhere with at least three waterfalls; we will never know.
