After playing D&D with his friends, Will heads to his home. He is attacked on the route by a demogorgon, and it finally kidnaps him from his home. In the first season, we are told about this spooky, cold, and dark mirror world called the Upside Down. Up until season 4, the Stranger Things universe remains pretty much the same. Upside Down is a mirror world frozen in time on Nov 6th, 1983. Every season, we are introduced to newer and newer creatures of this world. The Demogorgons, Demodogs, Demobats, and all the vines across seasons. Season 4 introduces a more sentient creature, Vecna, who is later revealed to be Henry Creel, Dr. Brenner’s very first kid, the 001. Controlling all of these creatures is the Mind Flayer particles. We are never really shown where they originated from, but everything from the Upside Down has these Mind Flayer particles in it, and in a sense, it fills life in them.
<br>

We have some major revelations in season 5. First eerie observation is that the Upside Down Hawkins is encircled by a giant wall that seemingly extends vertically forever. The center of this wall is the Hawkins Laboratory, aka Brenner’s Lab. Dustin finds a detailed notebook written by Dr. Brenner explaining the Wall and the Upside Down. So, Upside Down is actually a wormhole connecting Earth and a distant planet, Abyss, by a mere 2000-foot-long bridge, and Brenner somehow stabilized this bridge using Exotic Matter, which happens to be a swirling mass of particles at the top of the Lab in Upside Down. Does any of this make sense? Let’s dig deeper into this.
<br>

A wormhole is a theoretical connection between two points in space-time. It is a shortcut between two points in the same universe, and it enables faster-than-light travel. So, in theory, if the universe were a 2D plane as in the image, a wormhole is the tunnel that connects points 1 and 2 through a shortcut. In the Stranger Things universe, point 1 is Hawkins on planet Earth, and point 2 is the Abyss. For the people of Hawkins living in this 2D plane, the world outside the plane of their universe is the Upside Down, and the surface of the tunnel is analogous to the walls surrounding the Upside Down. How does this kind of structure come to be in the physical universe? Well, analogous to the image, if our universe we perceive is actually a 3D projection in a 4D world, then such a connection could be possible. Some kind of negative energy density is required to prevent such a tunnel from collapsing under its own gravity. All of this is super involved, and I don’t have the expertise to explain it in detail. Let’s see how this has been explained in the show.
<br>

Did you notice how, for a 2D universe, the tunnel is actually a 3D entity? So, in the show, the wormhole which connects Earth and Abyss, each of which is clearly three-dimensional, must be a 4D entity. Where is the four-dimensional wormhole in the show? It is nowhere to be seen. \\

The show’s version of the tunnel is as shown in the image on the right. In this image, if the Abyss is at the top and the Upside Down Hawkins is at the bottom, then where is the real Hawkins? To be fair, an accurate depiction of such a 4D tunnel would not have been possible with the show’s premise of such easy traversability of the Upside Down. We can see a more accurate depiction of a wormhole in the movie Interstellar, and such a wormhole would not have worked for Stranger Things. Fine, let’s take the wormhole for what it is, and also that Dr. Brenner was able to stabilize the wormhole with Exotic Matter; in our universe, it would be a Nobel Prize-worthy achievement.
<br>

The next question is how the tunnel was created. Let’s start from the beginning. Henry Creel gets his psychic powers from a stone (Does it contain the Mind Flayer particles? Unsure). Dr. Brenner uses his blood to create more kids with psychic powers. Eleven fights with Henry, and she banished him from Earth to the Abyss. Now, Brenner uses El to search for where she sent Henry. In one of these searches, El makes contact with a Demogorgon, which was still living in the Abyss, and at this moment, she creates the wormhole on Nov 6th, 1983. The Upside Down is created, and so is the bridge. After that, it is really unclear when Brenner worked on creating the Exotic Matter and thus stabilizing the wormhole. From the looks of it, the wormhole was stable on its own for quite some time before Brenner set up his Exotic Matter stabilizer. I feel this is a major plot hole. Think about it, if destroying the Exotic Matter instantly collapsed the wormhole, as it did in the finale, how did it stay stable till Brenner built it? I wish the Duffers had explained this better.

Okay, that was a long one. I love this show for all the human emotions that it shows, but I wish they had a tighter plot and better explanations about the show’s universe.
