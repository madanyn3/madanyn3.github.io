Ever woken up from an 8-hour sleep and actually felt more tired than you were before? A doctor might diagnose this in a number of ways, but surely a cup of black coffee should fix it. A recent such episode got me into thinking _could evolution have done better with sleep?_. I know there are plenty of upsides to sleep, and matter of fact, a human body will start to deteriorate if deprived of sleep long enough. Sleeping is a biological need for humans, like it is for every animal. Our body does a lot of important things during sleep,<br>
- The brain shuts off and the neurons restore ion and ATP balance<br>
- We replay experiences and consolidate memory for storage<br>
- There is a real cleansing of the brain with the removal of waste products released by neurons<br>

Many other processes happen in sleep, but these are the uniquely sleep-dependent ones. Bottom line: you can't skip it. <br>

All things said, imagine if sleep were not as stringent a requirement. We recover one-third of our life that would otherwise go _waste_ in sleep, think about how many more places you could visit in your trips. In fact, there are some animals that are very different from us in this respect. Dolphins, Seals, etc. do _unihemispheric sleep_ i.e., only one half of the brain sleeps. Fish and many migratory birds take _microsleeps_ i.e., seconds-long naps scattered across the day. So, why didn't humans evolve either of those kinds of sleep? Think about how much it would've helped out ancestors in keeping predators at bay-no taking turns in guarding the fire camp. <br>

It is a popular belief that natural selection picks individuals with the best characteristics and in turn, evolution guides life into greater and greater optimality. It makes sense, too. The mystical force of nature must be the best at what it does, right? No, it is not. Evolution doesn't strive for long-term optimality, only short-term reproductive success. Once a solution is "good enough" to survive and reproduce, evolution rarely replaces the solution unless a strong selective pressure demands it-read an extinction-threatening disaster. That means the uncompromisable need for sleep in humans is a result of patchwork by natural selection, and sadly, there is little one can do about it. But this got me thinking, _what else is suboptimal in us?_<br>

What about the human cognitiona and consciousness? Our brain is result of millions of years of evolution and we still have traces of our anscestors. The replitian brain for survival and reflec (read all the involuentary actions), limbic system for emotions and social bonding (read love, hate, sense of me and my community) and the frontal cortex for abstract reasoning, all three in the order they evolved. Our brain is nowhere close to being optimal. It is the same brain that can do math and philosophy, but still gets hijacked by cravings, fears and biases. Consciousness is no different. Its origin in humans can be traced back to first social animals. It becomes important to distinguish self (read me and my community) from others (read everything else) for the survival of the group. But did we become too <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcK-dg3FPRM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conscious</a>? All the anxiety, existential dread, depression and the tragic steps that people take due to that all stem from self-consciousness. <br>

It makes me wonder, what a truly optimal cognition and consciousness might have looked like?
