Technically, if I take the wormhole theory, the *Abyss* is just another part of out own universe which is connected to our part of the universe thorugh the *bridge* aka the *upside down*. I just finished the final epiosode and I am filled with all kinds of emotions; a lot of nostalgia. I discovered this show in late 2020, post the covid lockdown period and I have been following this show ever since.

Personally, there are a lot of plot holes in the show, especially in the final season but I think scientific accuracy is not the right lens to assess this show through. Over time, my friends, my cousins and my family got picked up by the show and we are a bunch of *ST Nerds* discussing about the show with so much enthusiasm. I feel like the show has really been an important part of my growth over the last 5 years.

These are my first thoughts about the finale and the show's ending overall. I plan to delve deep into the details about the plot overall, the ending, the characters, El in particular. I always felt that for everthing to end and for life on Earth to get back to normal, El must die. She is the heart of the plot. Yes, she ended things on her terms but when all the characters got such good endings, maybe El could have too? Or would that have been too much?

Finally, Netflix has confirmed that there will be spin-offs and I hope they make one about Steve and Dustin. At this point it is a cliché to say that. A spin-off about Mike would be interesting too. It would be interesting to see how he shapes his life moving forward..
