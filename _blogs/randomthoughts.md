### Human - A Primate

I was thinking of capturing human behavior in a single sentence. After some thought, listing the essential features of a human being—A species of the order Primate. I took help from my dear friend ChatGPT in collapsing them into a single sentence. <br>
**Humans are a bunch of self-interested, territorial, social beings driven by the instincts to eat, survive, and reproduce**

### Define Life

One can define life in a number of ways. Some are philosophical, some others are poetical. What is life at its fundamental level? I wanted a simple definition of life, one devoid of all the adjectives. But it shouldn't be too simplified as to talk in terms of quantum electrodynamics. I thought of this <br>
**Life - A Gigantic Synchrony of Chemical Reactions**

### Life - The Oldest Mystery

No matter how far into human history one goes, humans can be seen tinkering about this question in one way or the other. *Why is Life?* is a harder question than *What is Life?* The other day I had a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67673655-b20c-8012-900e-6b25203504ae" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversation</a> with ChatGPT (A subject matter expert at anyone's fingertips) about the *Why* question. With all the limitations of my conversation I derived this conclusion — **At the planetary scale, life emerges from favorable conditions and the physical laws like the law of entropy. At the cosmic scale, life is an accident in an indifferent universe** <br>

So all of us are the result of just an accident? That is very tough! If it is not an accident then did someone (or something) create us? If so for *Why?* (another why question!). For me, either case is equally scary and fascinating
